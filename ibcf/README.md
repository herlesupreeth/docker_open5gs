This is a basic kind of IBCF based on Asterisk to handle calls from and to Docker_open5gs, I tried my best to do all the configs, but it still requires your adjustments.

Please read the Comments carefully before starting the container, specially in : pjsip.conf, acl.conf, extenteions.conf and voiemail.conf, those files must be configured otherwise the IBCF will not work properly!!

have fun Testing!
